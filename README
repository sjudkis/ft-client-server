Compilation:
    compile ftserver with: "make"
    makefile is included

Execution:
    Start server with: "./ftserver <PORT>"
    Server will start listening for connections on given port, if available

    Client can be executed with two command formats:
        list directory: "ftclient.py <HOST_NAME> <COMMAND_PORT> -l <DATA_PORT>"
        file transfer: "ftclient.py <HOST_NAME> <COMMAND_PORT> -g <FILENAME> <DATA_PORT>"

    Client will connect to server on host  <HOST_NAME> and send command via <COMMAND_PORT>
    Data from server will be transferred on <DATA_PORT>


When the Server sends the list of files in the directory, it does not include hidden files.

When checking if a requested file exists, the Server compares the file name to the list
of files within the directory. Hidden files will not be transmitted. file paths will
also not be accepted because the file at the end of the path is not in the current directory. 

The Server checks if the requested file is actually a directory and sends an error message to 
the client if so. 

If the client requests a file with a filename that already exists in the clients directory,
the user will be asked if they want to replace the old file with the new one.
